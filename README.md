**Cap Table** The model contains an integrated cap table and exit waterfall that allows you to map out a number of fundraising rounds - from friends and family to F rounds and beyond, using whatever terms you are using for your rounds - using equity, convertible notes, SAFEs, and crypto issuances, and keeps track of ownership, dilution, and value throughout all rounds.

Handles the creation of option pools (either created in the premoney or the postmoney) and the conversion of convertible instruments to equity, using either the premoney, postmoney, or percentage ownership method.

Summary cap table provides a quick view of the major shareholders, simply select which round you want to show (and optionally, if you want to compare two rounds) and the summary automatically adjusts.

This cap table is slightly different than the cap table integrated into the Standard Financial Model, as it provides more options and detail behind how cap tables work, and is easier to edit and understand.

As a note, maintaining a clean, accurate cap table for an operating company is difficult, and especially difficult in Excel. But when you want to understand how a capitalization table works and forecast how rounds of financing impact ownership, valuation, dilution, and exit proceeds, a spreadsheet can be great.

**Venture Valuation**
Extra sheet for both investors and entrepreneurs to help value a company, using an expectation of future funding needs, exit potential, and valuations. Creates an analysis of proceeds, IRRs, and gross multiples given a range of investment and follow-on strategies.

Combines your forecast of the rates of companies raising additional rounds, failing, and exiting, with your forecast of exit multiples at each investment stage, to create probability-adjusted proceeds, IRRs, and gross multiples for an investment.

This sheet is a standalone sheet inside the tool, and thus can be used independently to evaluate a company’s valuation and expectation of proceeds to investors.

Once you’re running a company, I highly suggest checking out an online cap table management platform, including Carta, Captable, Visible, Capshare and others.
