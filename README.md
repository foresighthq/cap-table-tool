**Cap Table** The model contains an integrated cap table and exit waterfall that allows you to map out a number of fundraising rounds - from friends and family to F rounds and beyond, using whatever terms you are using for your rounds - using equity, convertible notes, SAFEs, and crypto issuances, and keeps track of ownership, dilution, and value throughout all rounds.

Handles the creation of option pools (either created in the premoney or the postmoney) and the conversion of convertible instruments to equity, using either the premoney, postmoney, or percentage ownership method.

Summary cap table provides a quick view of the major shareholders, simply select which round you want to show (and optionally, if you want to compare two rounds) and the summary automatically adjusts.

This cap table is slightly different than the cap table integrated into the Standard Financial Model, as it provides more options and detail behind how cap tables work, and is easier to edit and understand.

As a note, maintaining a clean, accurate cap table for an operating company is difficult, and especially difficult in Excel. But when you want to understand how a capitalization table works and forecast how rounds of financing impact ownership, valuation, dilution, and exit proceeds, a spreadsheet can be great.

Once you’re running a company, I highly suggest checking out an online cap table management platform, including [Carta](https://carta.com/), [Captable](https://captable.io/), [Visible](https://visible.vc), [Capshare](https://www.capshare.com/) and others.

**Exit Waterfall**

The exit waterfall takes the cap table and evaluates the distribution of proceeds to different classes of shareholders based on different liquidation preference structures, conversion scenarios, and the seniority of different share classes.

Visualizes the distribution of proceeds across a range of exit values, so that you can clearly see the impact of structures and the distribution to shareholders over multiple exit scenarios.

Assign each preferred equity share class as nonparticipating, full participating, or participating with a cap, and the model automatically adjusts the distribution of proceeds accordingly.

Summarizes the distribution of proceed with two charts to clearly show the % distribution and the total distribution of proceeds.

**Equity Issuance**

Extra instructional sheets to show you the mechanics behind issuing a new equity round. Extensively noted to provide context and instructions to help teach you how to create your own cap table from scratch.

**Conversion Methods**

Extra instructional sheets to show how different methods of converting convertibles work, showing how the choice of conversion method impacts premoney valuation, postmoney valuation, share price, and share ownership. Demonstrates how discount rate, valuation caps, and interest rates impact conversions.

Provided examples of premoney conversion method, postmoney conversion method, and percentage ownership method, extensively noted to provide context and instructions to help teach you how to build conversions into your own cap table.

**Option Pools**

Extra instructional sheets to show how creating an option pool impacts valuation, share price, dilution, and ownership. Demonstrates how to create an option pool in the premoney and postmoney, and highlights how the method used impacts dilution of shareholders in funding rounds, an important part of understanding how option pools impact effective valuations.

Extensively noted with context and explanations for each line so that you can build in an option pool into your own cap table if needed.

**Venture Valuation**

Extra sheet for both investors and entrepreneurs to help value a company, using an expectation of future funding needs, exit potential, and valuations. Creates an analysis of proceeds, IRRs, and gross multiples given a range of investment and follow-on strategies.

Combines your forecast of the rates of companies raising additional rounds, failing, and exiting, with your forecast of exit multiples at each investment stage, to create probability-adjusted proceeds, IRRs, and gross multiples for an investment.

This sheet is a standalone sheet inside the tool, and thus can be used independently to evaluate a company’s valuation and expectation of proceeds to investors.
